<h1>Mini Project Dibimbing using React.js and MUDO API</h1>

<p>
  As a web developer I was asked to create a website with a food web theme using React.js by utilizing the API that has been provided and paying attention to good and attractive UI design.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>I have successfully created a website that meets all the requirements. Among others :</p>
<ol> 
  <li>Using API from <a href="https://mudoapi.tech/">MUDO</a></li>
  <li>
    The website that will be created must meet the following requirements :
    <ul>
      <li>User Can Register</li>
      <li>User Can Login</li>
      <li>Users can see all the menu lists on the website</li>
      <li>Users can see the page details of each menul</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There is <i>Pagination</i> on the Home Page</li>
  <li>The website has implemented <i>Protected Routes</i>. Which means users cannot enter the home page before logging in</li>
  <li>The website has implemented a <i>Responsive Website</i>. Which means that the display of the website can fit on different device sizes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>

<p>In addition to creating a website by paying attention to existing requirements. I also added some additional features. Among others:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Users can delete items from the menu</li>
  <li>Users can search for food by name</li>
  <li>Users can filter the menu that appears on the page according to the type of food (Main Dish, Beverage)</li>
